This project uses the `@ant-design/agentic-ui` component library, designed for building agentic user interfaces (like chat interfaces, tool outputs, etc.).

Always read:
- All files with a name that starts overview-
- All files in the design-tokens folder

Read the files in the guidelines/components directory when you want to use the component with that name. For example, if you want to use a Chat Bubble, read guidelines/components/bubble.md.

## Component Usage Guidelines - READ THIS FIRST

IMPORTANT: Always prefer to use components from `@ant-design/agentic-ui` if they exist.

IMPORTANT: Follow these steps IN ORDER before writing any code:

Step 1: Read Overview Files (REQUIRED)
Read ALL files with a name that starts with "overview-" in the guidelines directory:
overview-components.md
overview-icons.md

Step 2: Read Design Tokens (REQUIRED)
Read ALL files in the design-tokens/ folder.

Step 3: Plan what components you need to use (REQUIRED)

Step 4: Read Component Guidelines BEFORE Using Components (REQUIRED)
BEFORE using ANY component, you MUST read its guidelines file first.

Step 5: Plan what icons you need to use (REQUIRED)

DO NOT write code using a component until you have read its specific guidelines.
